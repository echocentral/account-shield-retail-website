              <p>To start using <em>Account Shield</em> you need to have an account with the service (if you haven't done so already, you can sign up <a href="signup.html">here</a>). This provides access to a Dashboard. Go to the 'Settings' area of the Dashboard, and follow the instructions there to register your web site and get it set up to work with <em>Account Shield</em>.</p>
              <p>When you have successfully completed these simple steps, you will have basic functionality enabled. Sessions will now begin to be logged and available for analysis in your Dashboard, and you are ready to go further.</p>
